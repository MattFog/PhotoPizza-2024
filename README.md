UPDATE 2024

Photopizza's original repository does not appear to be maintained any more.  The website <a href="www.photopizza.org"> appears to be offline as well, though there are some links in wayback machine.  No luck contacting the author.

This fork is an attempt to collect all the information on the project and populate it with all neccessary instructions and resources.
